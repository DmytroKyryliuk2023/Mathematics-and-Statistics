# Mathematics-and-Statistics
This repository contains calculation and graphical works for university courses in Linear Algebra and Calculus, as well as Probability and Statistics. The first folder includes one lab work in Linear Algebra covering topics such as vectors, matrices, linear equations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and one lab work in Calculus. Other folder contain works in Probability and Statistics, covering probability theory, conditional probability, Bayesâ€™ theorem, expected value, hypothesis testing, and parameter estimation. These works demonstrate practical application of mathematical and statistical methods, problem-solving, and analytical skills, with all solutions prepared individually and including detailed calculations and graphical representations.
